OpenSignals is a new innovative approach to the Observability and Controllability of scalable distributed service computing.

Inspired from concepts and techniques in signaling theory, stigmergy, systems thinking, and social cognition, OpenSignals offers a humane and scalable way to infer and reason about the local and global state of services, resources, and systems at various scales and scopes compared to other forms of instrumentation and measurement including tracing, metrics, events, and logging.

OpenSignals does not entirely replace existing Observability technologies when it comes to ad hoc data diagnostics; instead, it offers a vastly simplified model and superior means to reframe and contextualize data collected by other techniques in terms that are more meaningful, relevant, and effective for enterprise application monitoring and service level management purposes.

OpenSignals is explicitly designed to reflect and address the modern complex nature of software execution flow spanning multiple microservices, each with varying levels of resilience, reliability, availability, adaptability, change, and criticality to delivery.
